# OilyGiantProject9
# Strategic Development of Oil Wells in Diverse Terrains

## Objective
The primary objective of this research project is to **identify the most lucrative oil well locations** for OilyGiant Mining Co. This involves analyzing geological data across three distinct regions to predict reserve volumes, estimate potential profits, and assess operational risks.

## Methodology
The research methodology encompasses several key phases:

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
- Procurement of geological datasets from three designated regions.
- Preliminary data quality checks and preparation for analysis.

### 2. Predictive Modeling and Validation
- Application of linear regression models to estimate oil reserves in new well locations.
- Splitting data into training and validation sets (75:25 ratio).
- Prediction generation and model accuracy assessment using RMSE.

### 3. Economic Feasibility Analysis
- Storage of economic variables for profit calculations.
- Determination of break-even reserve volumes for financial viability.
- Summary of findings to inform the profit calculation phase.

### 4. Profit Maximization Algorithm
- Development of an algorithm to calculate potential profits from promising oil wells.
- Prioritization of wells for development based on predicted yields.
- Optimal region recommendation supported by profit estimates.

### 5. Risk Assessment and Regional Selection
- Bootstrapping technique application with 1000 samples to approximate profit distributions.
- Calculation of average profits, 95% confidence intervals, and loss risks.
- Final recommendation of a region for development, justified by a comprehensive risk-profit analysis.

## Data Overview
Geological exploration data for three regions is stored in CSV files, each containing unique identifiers for oil wells, three geological features, and reserve volumes.

## Operational Constraints
- Exclusive use of linear regression for predictive analysis.
- A fixed budget for the development of 200 wells.
- A minimum profit margin requirement after risk assessment.
- Only regions with a loss potential under 2.5% are considered.

## Confidentiality Clause
The datasets are synthetic and do not disclose any contractual details or specific well characteristics.

## Evaluation Metrics
Project success is evaluated based on:

- Adequacy of data preparation.
- Adherence to the outlined methodology.
- Consideration of business constraints.
- Accuracy of bootstrapping application.
- Justification for the selection of the development region.
